Hi guys.
This is my first calculator application.
I made it by Android Studio with the help of Java.



This is my first experience in development.
I started my coding journey about a year ago....... My first two months were spent scarching for the resorces.
C is my first programing language but i couldn't finish it.
I bought a used "Let us C - 12th edition" book from an old bookstore at the fair.
I learned about this.
But it seemed monotonous to code only in C.So i thought i should start app devlopment.
I had no Knowledge of java.But still i learned to use Android Studio.
Now i practice Java every day.I had a lot of problems when i was making this app(Especially Errors).
Apart from my academics,I have learned a lot.
I got a lot of experience out of it.






 

Application(ISSUES):

1) It can just stay Portrait.
2) It has only 24 functional buttons.
3) It can't autoresize Edittext.
